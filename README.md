# gotoline.vim

The absolute ultimate keybinding for `ctrl-l` for ViM and NeoVim!

* Press `ctrl-l` and then `return` to alternate between jumping to the top of a file and to the bottom of a file.
* Press `ctrl-l` and type `0` or `1` to jump to the first line.
* Press `ctrl-l` and type a line number to jump to that line.
* Press `ctrl-l` and type a line number after the end of the file to jump to the end of the file.

What more could you possibly want?

Add it to you ViM or NeoViM config, like this:

    Plug 'xyproto/gotoline.vim'
