# gotoline.vim

The ultimate keybinding for `ctrl-l` for ViM and NeoVim!

* Press `ctrl-l` and then `return` to alternate between jumping to the top of a file and to the bottom of a file.
* Press `ctrl-l` and type `0` or `1` to jump to the first line.
* Press `ctrl-l` and type a line number to jump to that line.
* Press `ctrl-l` and type a line number after the end of the file to jump to the end of the file.
